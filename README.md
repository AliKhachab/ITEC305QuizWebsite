# Our project
## What it was for
This project was a quiz website we were tasked to do for our final project in our Internet Programming class. We used HTML, CSS, and PHP to create a basic quiz website frontend and MySQL for the backend to store all quiz information.
## Who did what and why
For this project, we decided it would be interesting if we could get practice in things we usually do not work with. We all worked to a great extent on certain screens, but since most of them were based in homework assignments we already did prior, once those were done, we decided to focus on our weak points as programmers for practice. These will be explained below

This isn't to say we didn't help each other where we should have, though – if one of us noticed an issue where we specialized, we would point it out to make sure it was improved.

1) Login/Register screen – Ali (HTML, PHP, some CSS) and David (CSS)

These were quick to do because we had them done for our previous homework assignments.

2) home.php (screen where you select your quizzes) - Ali (HTML, PHP to create the buttons and route to quiz) and David (PHP to handle POST requests, CSS)

David mentioned that he still felt uncomfortable working with HTTP request superglobals and understanding how they worked between pages, so he decided to handle the ```<form>``` elements of this page.

3) Database – Ali (getting everyone set up with the database, creating DB + tables), David (creating questions)

Ali basically exclusively did frontend up until this semester, so he wanted to make the database schema on his own and get it working. Most of the SQL queries in the code were done by him as well, in order to make sure he got the database working correctly.

4) leaderboard.php – Alan (HTML, CSS, PHP)

This was based originally off of a homework assignment where we used Bootstrap for CSS and Postman to take fake JSON data and link it to users on a screen. Alan was able to modify it originally by using seeding data (fake data) to display the top 10 users with the highest scores.

5) results.php – Alan
